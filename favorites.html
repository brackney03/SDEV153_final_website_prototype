            <h2>My Favorites</h2>
            <p>One thing about me is that I am very, very opinionated when it comes to video games. Here are my favorites!</p>
            <h3>Splatoon</h3>
                <img src="https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1200/q_auto:best/f_auto/dpr_2.0/ncom/software/switch/70010000046395/94a4095cda06c4d85c637d1af451979f9933302b6b17174d97c45de7a68584a2" alt="Splatoon 3 Cover Art">
            <p>Growing up, all of the other kids around me really liked games like Halo, Call of Duty, and other FPS games. I never really got the appeal, I was happy playing 
                New Super Mario Bros. and Minecraft all by myself. That is, until the Summer of 2017, inside of a random K-Mart in Denver, Colorado. That's when I saw it, Splatoon 2. 
            13 year old me begged and begged my mom to buy it for me, and of course, she did. That's the day I fell in love with the unique shooter series, Splatoon. Splatoon is very
            unique compared to other shooters. It's very movement based, having to shoot ink and swim in it with speed to regain ammo or hide from enemy fire. Most notably, you don't
            have to kill anyone in Splatoon. Of course, you can, in fact you are highly rewarded for doing so. However, winning a game of Splatoon doesn't take kill counts, it takes
            turf coverage. You see, the winner of a round of Splatoon is calculated by how much each team has inked all over the map! I find Splatoon to be the perfect blend of casual
            and competitive, and boy does it get competitive. I always find myself coming back to Splatoon to hop into a match of Turf War just for a few rounds.</p>
            <h3>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</h3>
                <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/14/thousand-year-door-new-paper-mario-eurogamer-1694702434261.jpg" alt="A photo of Mario and all of his companions in Paper Mario: TTYD">
            <p>If you look up a list of any Nintendo fan's favorite games, this game will ALWAYS be on it. Paper Mario: TTYD is an adventure turn-based RPG game, where you travel
                through the world as Mario and his newfound friends. I love this game VERY much and I can't help but play through it once every year or so. The story is pretty great,
                but what makes this RPG truly shine is the characters and humor. Every companion Mario unlocks is full of personality and is constantly chiming in with witty jokes or
                comments to whatever is going on. Not to mention, the combat is very simple on the surface, but becomes pretty engaging as you progress. Instead of just choosing an
                attack and waiting for your turn to play out, you have to do action commands. Action commands are sort of a staple of Mario RPGs. Whenever you tell Mario to jump on an
                enemy, you have to press the A button at just the right time to do good damage. Every attack has it's own unique button inputs, which makes every moment of battle in 
                this game extremely engaging. However, as of recent, the Paper Mario games have fallen out of the RPG format and go for a more "Gimmicky Tech-Showcase Adventure" vibe,
                which has certainly torn the fandom apart. Personally, I like the newer games enough, but nothing will ever beat the classics when it comes to this great RPG-- heck, great
                RPG series.

            <h3>Wizard101/Pirate101</h3>
                <img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mOHy9E1gIlo/UDKLTzqrtzI/AAAAAAAAS3I/FMFE2FXmFp4/s1600/OnWaytoMons.jpg" alt="A pirate ship floating through the sky in Pirate101">
            <p>These games and I have some serious history. Back in the olden times of 2008, I was a wee child watching cartoons after school, whenever a commercial for Wizard101
                started playing. "I HAVE to play that game," I thought. And I did, my grandmother set me up with an account, and the rest is history. After 15 years, I'm still 
                playing. Wizard101 is a turn-based deck building MMORPG where you, the young wizard, have to set across the Spiral (Basically a bunch of broken up islands in space) to
                save the world and stop Malistaire. This game gets a lot of criticism, rightfully so, but it's full to the brim with a charm that almost makes giving children gambling addictions
             worth it. As for it's sister game, Pirate101, it's another turn-based RPG, but with a more similar to a tabletop playstyle like DND. I actually beta-tested this game
                when I was about 10. And yes, I still play it. I won't go too much into detail on these games because I'll write enough to fill a book, as I have over 15 years of consistent
                experience with these games. If you don't mind paying 10 dollars for a subscription every once in a while, definitely give these old relics a try.

            <h3>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</h3>
                <img src="https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/000VrgR92RHsFteaXzNZU1E-3.fit_scale.size_760x427.v1569479821.jpg" alt="An animal crossing villager standing in front of her house.">
            <p>One Thanksgiving in my adolesence, I was sitting on the couch next to my cousin watching her play a game I had never heard of. She was seemingly placing down furnature in a cartoonish
                house, with a big player's guidebook next to her. That is my first memory of Animal Crossing New Leaf. This game is like a warm hug, a pile of blankets that your mother puts on you when
                you're cold, a rainy summer night on the couch, a piping hot cup of ginger tea. This game got me through the roughest time in all of our lives: <strong>Middle School.</strong> I 
                was struggling with bullying, depression, and general loneliness, but I could always come home to a make-believe town full of little fake animal people who loved me for who I am.
                If you are feeling down and need a sense of purpose: PLAY THIS GAME. Animal Crossing progresses on a real-time basis. As the days pass in the real world, so will the days in your village. Your village will grow as time passes, and so will the things you can do.  I'm sure you've heard of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the new installment for the switch. Personally, I like this game. Sure, New Horizons has almost limitless customization features,
                but that's never really why I liked Animal Crossing. What makes Animal Crossing good to me, is how it was the perfect cozy life simulator. New Horizons lost a lot of its charm
                in the move towards the sandbox genre, which is why I prefer this cozy rainy day of a game.
